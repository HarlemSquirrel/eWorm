# eWorm
A book rating app on rails

# About
This was created for a series of projects for the Full Stack Web Development track at [Learn Verified][learn-co].

# Taking a Test Drive
You can get up and running by first cloning this repo.
```
git clone https://github.com/HarlemSquirrel/eWorm.git
```
Then take a look at the branches with `git branch -a` and then switch to a branch with `git checkout <branch-name>` The master branch has the first web app I built with rails running everything. The `jQuery-and-JSON` branch has some resources loading with JQuery talking to Rails via JSON get/post requests. The `angular-single-page-app` branch has more enhancements with everything running on a single page. Angular is really powerful and you can see what I've learned to implement.
